# GitHub Actions Workflow Location Fix

## 🔧 Issue Identified

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows were not running because they were located in the wrong directory.

**Root Cause**: The workflow file was placed in `ClashBerry/.github/workflows/` but GitHub Actions only looks for workflows in the repository root's `.github/workflows/` directory.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Moved Workflow to Root**
- **Old Location**: `ClashBerry/.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`
- **New Location**: `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` (repository root)

### 2. **Updated All Paths**
Updated the workflow to work from the root directory:

#### Gradle Commands
```yaml
# Before (relative to ClashBerry directory)
run: ./gradlew clean

# After (from repository root)
run: cd ClashBerry && ./gradlew clean
```

#### File Paths
```yaml
# Before
path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk

# After  
path: ClashBerry/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
```

#### Wrapper Validation
```yaml
# Added proper path for wrapper validation
gradle-wrapper-path: ClashBerry/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
```

### 3. **Updated Cache Keys**
```yaml
# Updated Gradle cache to include ClashBerry path
key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('ClashBerry/**/*.gradle*', 'ClashBerry/**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
```

## 📁 Current Repository Structure

```
Repository Root/
├── .github/workflows/           ✅ Workflows in ROOT (correct location)
│   └── build-apk.yml           
├── ClashBerry/                  📱 Android project
│   ├── app/
│   ├── gradle/wrapper/
│   └── gradlew
├── app.py                       🐍 Backend API
└── requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 What This Fixes

### ✅ **Workflows Now Trigger Correctly**
- Push to main/master → Workflow runs
- Pull requests → Workflow runs  
- Manual dispatch → Workflow runs

### ✅ **Proper Build Process**
- Builds from repository root
- Correctly finds ClashBerry project
- Uploads APKs with proper paths
- Creates releases with correct files

### ✅ **All Paths Resolved**
- Gradle wrapper: `ClashBerry/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
- Build outputs: `ClashBerry/app/build/outputs/apk/`
- Gradle scripts: `ClashBerry/gradlew`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** - Workflows will now trigger automatically
2. **Check Actions Tab** - Should see the workflow running
3. **Monitor Build** - APK building should work correctly
4. **Download APKs** - Available in artifacts and releases

## 📋 Files Modified

### Moved Files:
- `ClashBerry/.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` → `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`

### Updated Documentation:
- `ClashBerry/README.md` - Updated project structure
- `ClashBerry/GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIX.md` - Updated file paths
- `ClashBerry/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated workflow location

## ✨ Result

GitHub Actions will now:
- ✅ **Detect workflows** (in correct root location)
- ✅ **Build Android APKs** (with proper paths)
- ✅ **Upload artifacts** (debug + release)
- ✅ **Create releases** (on main branch)

**The workflow should now run automatically when you push to GitHub!** 🎉
